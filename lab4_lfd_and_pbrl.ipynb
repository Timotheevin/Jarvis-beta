        "\n",
        "The purpose of this lab is to introduce some classic algorithms of *Learning from Demonstrations*. We will see how they work, their caveats and benefits.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Learning from Demonstrations* (LfD) is an approach in reinforcement learning where an agent learns behaviors by observing examples provided by a demonstrator. This field is divided into two main branches: *Imitation Learning* and *Inverse Reinforcement Learning* (IRL).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Imitation Learning** involves directly mimicking the demonstrator's actions. The agent learns to replicate the demonstrated behavior without attempting to infer the underlying objectives or rewards driving the actions. It focuses on reproducing successful behaviors in a given task, often through supervised learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)**, on the other hand, seeks to infer the demonstrator's underlying reward function. Instead of copying actions, the agent tries to discover the goals or preferences that motivated the demonstrator’s behavior. Once the reward function is learned, the agent can optimize its own policy to achieve similar outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main objective of *Learning from Demonstrations* is to enable agents to learn effectively in settings where the reward function is unknown or poorly defined, by leveraging expert demonstrations as a source of supervisory signal."

        "*Behavioral Cloning* ([D. A. Pomerleau, *Efficient Training of Artificial Neural Networks for Autonomous Navigation*, Neural Computation, vol. 3, no. 1, pp. 88–97, 1991](https://cours.etsmtl.ca/sys843/REFS/ORG/pomerleau_alvinn.pdf)) is one of the most fundamental approaches to *Imitation Learning*. The concept is straightforward: an *expert* provides high-quality traces, or demonstrations, and the learning agent's task is to mimic the expert’s behavior.\n",
        "In *Imitation Learning*, *traces* or *demonstrations* refer to sequences of state-action pairs generated by an expert while performing a task. These demonstrations serve as examples for the agent to learn from. Each demonstration consists of a series of observations (states) encountered by the expert, along with the corresponding actions taken in those states.\n",
        "For example, in a driving task, a demonstration might be a series of snapshots of the environment (such as the car’s position and speed) and the actions the expert driver took at each moment (such as steering or braking). These state-action pairs are recorded and used to train the agent, enabling it to learn how to behave similarly in similar situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of *Behavioral Cloning* is to map states to the actions the expert would take, essentially allowing the agent to \"clone\" the expert's behavior. The quality and variety of these demonstrations are critical for successful learning, as they provide the agent with the knowledge it needs to act appropriately across different scenarios.\n",
        "Typically, expert demonstrations are obtained by recording human behavior, which is then used to train the agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: In the original publication, the algorithm learns a stochastic policy by maximizing the likelihood of the expert's actions. However, in this lab, we will train a deterministic policy by minimizing the Categorical Cross Entropy between the expert's actions and the model’s predictions."

        "\n",
        "This implementation of GAIL is intentionally kept simple to focus on understanding the core algorithm without the complexity of advanced policy training procedures. We use the **REINFORCE** algorithm (vanilla policy gradient) to train the policy, which makes the learning process transparent and easier to follow.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, this simplicity comes at a cost: the training can be **less efficient and less stable** compared to more sophisticated approaches. In the original GAIL paper ([Ho & Ermon, 2016](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2016/file/cc7e2b878868cbae992d1fb743995d8f-Paper.pdf)), the authors used **Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)** to train the policy, which provides better stability and sample efficiency through constrained optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "In modern practice, **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** has become the most widely used algorithm for training the policy in GAIL implementations. PPO offers a good balance between:\n",
        "- Implementation simplicity (compared to TRPO)\n",
        "- Training stability (compared to REINFORCE)\n",
        "- Sample efficiency\n",
        "- Robustness across different environments\n",
        "\n",
        "For production-level implementations or more challenging environments, consider replacing the REINFORCE-based policy training with PPO or TRPO to achieve significantly better performance and stability."
